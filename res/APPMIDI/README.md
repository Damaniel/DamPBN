# Application MIDIs

If the following files are present, they'll be played at the appropriate times:

title.mid
  Plays at the title screen
complete.mid               
  Plays when an image is complete or from a replay

If they're not present, the game won't play music at those times.  

Much like the general MUSIC folder, I don't have any known Creative Commons
or open source/permissive MIDIs, so you'll have to provide your own.
